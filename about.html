    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Fedora Developer Portal is a place for developers running Fedora on their workstation or virtual machine for their
      development needs. Fedora offers plenty of packages for developers, but they were not that easy to find
      and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the goal of this site is to present the packages available on Fedora and explain how to use them.
    </p>

    <h2>Contribute</h2>
    <p>
      Development of Fedora Developer Portal takes place on <a href="https://github.com/developer-portal">GitHub.com</a>.
      There are two separated projects under Developer Portal organization:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://github.com/developer-portal/website">website</a> for the technical implementation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
